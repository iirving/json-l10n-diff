# Dual File Viewer Component - Build Summary

## Overview

Built a comprehensive dual JSON file viewer component based on the specifications in `docs/create-dual-file-viewer`.

## Components Created

### 1. DualFileViewer.vue

**Location:** `src/components/DualFileViewer.vue`

**Purpose:** Main component that displays two JSON files side-by-side with a unified tree structure

**Key Features:**

- Uses file1's keys as the primary tree structure
- Shows values from both files for each key
- Highlights differences with color coding:
  - **Yellow (#fff9c4)**: Different values
  - **Light Red (#ffebee)**: Keys missing in file2
  - **Light Blue (#e3f2fd)**: Keys missing in file1 (temporary keys)
- Expandable/collapsible nested objects
- Expand All / Collapse All functionality
- Emits events for adding missing keys to either file

**Props:**

- `file1` (Object): First JSON file
- `file2` (Object): Second JSON file

**Events:**

- `add-key-to-file1`: Triggered when user wants to add a key to file1
- `add-key-to-file2`: Triggered when user wants to add a key to file2
- `value-changed`: For future value editing functionality

**Methods (exposed):**

- `expandAll()`: Expands all nested objects
- `collapseAll()`: Collapses all nested objects

### 2. DualTreeNode.vue

**Location:** `src/components/DualTreeNode.vue`

**Purpose:** Recursive component that renders each row in the dual file viewer

**Key Features:**

- Displays key name with expand/collapse icon for nested objects
- Shows values from both files side-by-side
- Color-coded background based on diff status
- "Add" buttons for missing keys
- Temporary badge for keys that exist only in file2
- Recursive rendering for nested structures
- Indentation based on depth (16px per level)

**Props:**

- `node` (Object): Node data including key, values, status, children
- `depth` (Number): Nesting depth for indentation
- `isExpanded` (Boolean): Whether node is expanded

**Events:**

- `toggle`: Node expansion toggled
- `add-to-file1`: Add key to file1
- `add-to-file2`: Add key to file2

### 3. DualViewerDemo.vue

**Location:** `src/pages/DualViewerDemo.vue`

**Purpose:** Demo page showcasing the DualFileViewer with sample data

**Features:**

- Sample data with various scenarios:
  - Identical values
  - Different values
  - Missing keys in both directions
  - Nested objects
  - Temporary keys from file2
- Toggle between sample data and file upload
- Visual legend explaining color codes
- Comprehensive instructions
- File upload functionality for testing with custom JSON files

## Requirements Fulfilled

✅ **Takes 2 JSON files as input**

- Props: `file1` and `file2`

✅ **Uses file1 keys to build basic tree structure**

- Tree structure is built from file1's keys
- File2-only keys shown as temporary

✅ **Shows values from both files for each key**

- Side-by-side value display with two columns

✅ **Marks different values (yellow highlight)**

- Different values have yellow background (#fff9c4)

✅ **Shows missing keys in file2 with way to add**

- Light red background with "+ Add" button

✅ **Shows missing keys from file1 (temporary keys)**

- Light blue background with "(temp)" badge
- Can be added to file1 with "+ Add" button

## How to Access

1. **Development Server:**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   Access at: <http://localhost:5174/>

2. **Navigate to Demo:**
   - Click "Dual Viewer" in the navigation bar
   - Or directly access: <http://localhost:5174/#/dual-viewer>

## Usage Example

```vue
<template>
  <DualFileViewer
    :file1="jsonFile1"
    :file2="jsonFile2"
    @add-key-to-file1="handleAddToFile1"
    @add-key-to-file2="handleAddToFile2"
  />
</template>

<script setup>
import DualFileViewer from '@/components/DualFileViewer.vue';

const jsonFile1 = {
  app: {
    title: 'My App',
    version: '1.0.0'
  }
};

const jsonFile2 = {
  app: {
    title: 'My App',
    version: '2.0.0',
    newFeature: true
  }
};

const handleAddToFile1 = ({ keyPath, value }) => {
  // Implement adding key to file1
  console.log('Add to file1:', keyPath, value);
};

const handleAddToFile2 = ({ keyPath, value }) => {
  // Implement adding key to file2
  console.log('Add to file2:', keyPath, value);
};
</script>
```

## Architecture

### Data Flow

1. Component receives `file1` and `file2` props
2. `useJsonDiff` composable calculates differences
3. Tree structure is built with unified keys from both files
4. DualTreeNode recursively renders each node
5. User interactions emit events back to parent

### State Management

- `expandedNodes`: Set of expanded node key paths
- `diffStatusMap`: Map for quick diff status lookup
- `treeStructure`: Computed unified tree structure

### Styling

- Monaco/Menlo monospace font for code-like appearance
- Responsive grid layout for value columns
- Hover effects for better UX
- Color-coded backgrounds for diff status
- Smooth transitions

## Testing

The demo page includes comprehensive sample data demonstrating:

- Identical values
- Different values (yellow)
- Missing in file2 (red)
- Missing in file1 / temporary (blue)
- Nested objects
- Multiple levels of nesting

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:

1. Inline value editing
2. Bulk add operations
3. Search/filter functionality
4. Export diff report
5. Undo/redo functionality
6. Keyboard navigation
7. Copy key paths
8. JSON path display on hover

## Files Modified

- `src/App.vue` - Added route for DualViewerDemo page
- Created `src/components/DualFileViewer.vue`
- Created `src/components/DualTreeNode.vue`
- Created `src/pages/DualViewerDemo.vue`

## Code Quality

- ✅ All files pass ESLint
- ✅ All files formatted with Prettier
- ✅ Following Vue 3 Composition API best practices
- ✅ Comprehensive JSDoc comments
- ✅ Semantic variable names
- ✅ Proper event handling
- ✅ Responsive design
