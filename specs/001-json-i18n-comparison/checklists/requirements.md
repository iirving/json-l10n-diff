# Specification Quality Checklist: JSON i18n Comparison and Diff Tool

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: October 12, 2025
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

### Content Quality Assessment

✅ **PASS** - The specification focuses entirely on user needs and behaviors:

- Uses user-centric language ("developer uploads", "user clicks")
- Describes WHAT the system does, not HOW it's built
- No mention of frameworks, libraries, or technical implementation
- All sections completed with concrete details

### Requirement Completeness Assessment

✅ **PASS** - All requirements are complete and unambiguous:

- No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present
- Each functional requirement is specific and testable (e.g., "System MUST highlight keys...in red")
- Success criteria include specific metrics (e.g., "within 3 seconds", "90% of users", "100% validity")
- All success criteria are technology-agnostic (focused on user outcomes, not system internals)
- Edge cases cover error handling, boundaries, and unexpected inputs
- Clear scope definition with "Out of Scope" section
- Assumptions documented (e.g., "Users are familiar with JSON", "client-side processing")

### Feature Readiness Assessment

✅ **PASS** - Feature is ready for planning:

- 30 functional requirements organized by feature area
- 5 prioritized user stories (3 P1, 1 P2, 1 P3) with acceptance scenarios
- 10 measurable success criteria covering performance, accuracy, and usability
- All user stories have clear "Independent Test" descriptions
- No implementation leakage detected

## Notes

- **Specification Quality**: Excellent - comprehensive and well-structured
- **Prioritization**: User stories are properly prioritized with P1 covering core MVP functionality
- **Testability**: All requirements can be verified through user-facing tests
- **Monetization**: Clear tier structure defined (Free/Medium/Enterprise)
- **Ready for Next Phase**: ✅ Specification is ready for `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`

### Strengths

1. Clear visual distinction system (red for missing, yellow for identical)
2. Well-defined tier limits with specific key counts
3. Comprehensive edge case coverage
4. Strong focus on user workflows and value delivery
5. Realistic success criteria that can be measured

### Potential Considerations for Planning Phase

- Determine indentation preference for prettify (2 vs 4 spaces) during implementation
- Define specific behavior for "different values" display (currently "neutral color")
- Consider progressive disclosure for deeply nested structures (10+ levels edge case)
