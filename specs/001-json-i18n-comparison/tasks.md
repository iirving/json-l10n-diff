# Tasks: JSON i18n Comparison and Diff Tool

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-json-i18n-comparison/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/component-contracts.md

**Tests**: Tests are included as separate tasks for each implementation. Test tasks can be skipped if testing is not required, but they are recommended for quality assurance.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3, US4, US5)
- **[TEST]**: Test task - can be skipped if testing is not desired
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

- **Single-page web app**: `src/` at repository root
- All Vue components: `src/components/`
- All composables: `src/composables/`
- All utilities: `src/utils/`
- All tests: `tests/` (mirroring src structure)

---

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Project initialization and basic structure

- [ ] T001 Create directory structure: `src/components/`, `src/pages/`, `src/stores/`, `src/composables/`, `src/utils/`, `tests/utils/`, `tests/composables/`, `tests/components/`, `tests/stores/`
- [ ] T002 Install and configure Pinia in `src/main.js` (createPinia, app.use(pinia))
- [ ] T003 Update `src/style.css` with base styles for tree viewer, color coding (red/yellow/neutral), navigation, and responsive layout
- [ ] T004 [P] Create placeholder components for FileUploader, TreeViewer, ComparisonView, KeyDiffItem, EditControls, TierGate in `src/components/`
- [ ] T005 [P] Create `src/pages/Index.vue` placeholder (main application page)
- [ ] T006 [P] Create `src/pages/About.vue` with static content (features, pricing, how it works, technical details)
- [ ] T007 Update `src/App.vue` with navigation structure (simple client-side routing between Index and About pages)

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

- [x] T012 [P] Create Pinia store `src/stores/useFileStore.js` (state: file1, file2, diffResults; actions: setFile1, setFile2, runComparison, reset)
- [x] T012-TEST [P] [TEST] Write unit tests for useFileStore in `tests/stores/useFileStore.test.js` (test all actions, state updates, runComparison logic, reset functionality, aim for 90%+ coverage)
- [x] T014 [P] Create Pinia store `src/stores/useEditStore.js` (state: editHistory Map, file1Modified, file2Modified; actions: addEdit, applyEdit, clearEdits)
- [x] T014-TEST [P] [TEST] Write unit tests for useEditStore in `tests/stores/useEditStore.test.js` (test edit tracking, applyEdit, clearEdits, history management, aim for 90%+ coverage)

**Checkpoint**: Foundation ready - user story implementation can now begin in parallel

---

## Phase 3: User Story 1 - View and Compare Basic i18n Files (Priority: P1) üéØ MVP

**Goal**: Allow users to upload two JSON i18n files and visualize differences with color-coded highlights (red for missing keys, yellow for identical values, neutral for different values)

**Independent Test**: Upload two valid JSON files with nested keys (e.g., en.json with `{"app": {"title": "My App"}}` and fr.json with `{"app": {"title": "Mon App", "welcome": "Bienvenue"}}`), verify tree displays both files with correct highlighting (red for missing "welcome" in file1, neutral for "title" with different values)

---

## Phase 4: User Story 2 - Edit and Add Missing Keys (Priority: P1)

**Goal**: Allow users to inline-edit values and add missing keys directly in the comparison view

**Independent Test**: Load two files with a missing key (e.g., "app.welcome" missing in file1), click "add key" button on red-highlighted key, verify key is added to file1's data structure and highlighted yellow if values now match, or neutral if different

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-5)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User Story 1 (P1): Can start after Phase 2
  - User Story 2 (P1): Can start after Phase 2, but Task T019 depends on T010 (useJsonDiff) from US1
  - User Story 3 (P1): Can start after Phase 2
- **Polish (Phase 6)**: Depends on desired user stories being complete (minimally US1-US3 for MVP)

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: No dependencies on other stories - can be fully completed independently
- **User Story 2 (P1)**: Depends on US1 T016 (useJsonDiff) for re-running comparison after edits
- **User Story 3 (P1)**: No dependencies on other stories - can be fully completed independently (but makes most sense after US2 for editing)

### Within Each User Story

- **US1**: T015-T016-T017 can run in parallel ([P]), then T018 depends on T017, T019 can run parallel with T018, T020 depends on T018 and T019, T021 depends on all previous
- **US2**: T022-T023-T024 can run in parallel ([P]), T025 depends on all three, T026 depends on T025
- **US3**: T027-T028-T031 can run in parallel ([P]), T029 depends on T028, T030 depends on T027 and T031, T032 can run parallel with others

### Parallel Opportunities

**Phase 1 (Setup)**:

- T001 must complete first (creates directories)
- T002 must complete second (installs and configures Pinia)
- T003, T004, T005, T006, T007 can run in parallel after T001 and T002

**Phase 2 (Foundational)**:

- T008 must complete first (keyCounter needed by useJsonParser)
- T009, T010, T012, T014 can run in parallel after T008 (2 Pinia stores can be created in parallel)
- T011 depends on T008, T009, T010

**Phase 3 (User Story 1)**:

```bash
# Launch in parallel:
T015: FileUploader component
T016: useJsonDiff composable
T017: TreeNode in TreeViewer

# Then after T017:
T018: Complete TreeViewer

# Then in parallel:
T019: KeyDiffItem component

# Then after T018 and T019:
T020: ComparisonView component

# Finally:
T021: Integrate in Index.vue with Pinia stores
```

**Phase 4 (User Story 2)**:

```bash
# Launch in parallel:
T022: EditControls component
T023: Inline edit in TreeViewer
T024: Add key action in KeyDiffItem

# Then after all three:
T025: Wire edit events to useEditStore in Index.vue
T026: Visual feedback for modified state
```

**Phase 5 (User Story 3)**:

```bash
# Launch in parallel:
T027: prettifyJson utility
T028: useFileDownload composable
T031: PrettifyWarning modal

# Then after T028:
T029: Wire save in Index.vue

# Then after T027 and T031:
T030: Wire prettify in Index.vue

# Can run anytime in parallel:
T032: File validation in FileUploader
```

**Phase 6 (Polish)** - All tasks T042-T053 can run in parallel (different concerns, different files)

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1 Core Components

```bash
# Three developers can work simultaneously after Phase 2 completes:
Developer A: T015 "Implement FileUploader component in src/components/FileUploader.vue"
Developer B: T016 "Implement recursive diff algorithm in src/composables/useJsonDiff.js"
Developer C: T017 "Implement TreeNode component in src/components/TreeViewer.vue"

# All three can commit without conflicts (different files)
```

- **Estimated MVP Timeline**: 2-3 weeks (1 developer) or 1.5-2 weeks (3 developers parallel)
- **Estimated Full Timeline**: 3-3.5 weeks (1 developer) or 2-2.5 weeks (3 developers parallel)

### Task Count by User Story

- Setup: 7 implementation tasks
- Foundational: 10 tasks (5 implementation + 5 test) - includes 2 Pinia stores
- User Story 1 (P1): 14 tasks (7 implementation + 7 test) - Core comparison view

- User Story 3 (P1): 12 tasks (6 implementation + 6 test) - Save and validation
- Polish: 21 tasks (11 implementation + 9 test + 1 coverage validation) - Quality improvements

### Test Strategy

- **Test Location**: All tests in `tests/` directory mirroring `src/` structure
- **Coverage Target**: 90%+ for all modules
- **Test Framework**: Vitest with Vue Test Utils
- **Test Types**: Unit tests for utilities/composables, component tests for Vue components, integration tests for pages
- **Test Tasks**: Marked with [TEST] tag - can be skipped if testing is not required, but recommended for quality
- **Coverage Validation**: Final task T053 runs coverage report to verify 90%+ threshold

### Notes on Testing

- All test tasks are marked with [TEST] tag for easy identification
- Test tasks follow immediately after their implementation tasks
- Tests can be skipped if not desired, but 90%+ coverage is recommended per coding guidelines
- Use Vitest for all testing: `npm run test` or `npm run test:coverage`
- Tests are in separate `tests/` directory to keep src clean
- Component tests should test rendering, props, events, and user interactions
- Store tests should test state management, actions, and getters
- Utility/composable tests should test all code paths and edge cases
