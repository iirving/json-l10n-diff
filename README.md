# JSON l10n Diff Tool

[![CI](https://github.com/iirving/json-l10n-diff/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/iirving/json-l10n-diff/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

> **⚠️ Status**: Coming Soon - In Active Development

Compare and synchronize your translation files effortlessly. A fast, secure, browser-based tool for managing JSON localization files across multiple languages.

## Why JSON l10n Diff?

**Perfect for developers, translators, and localization teams** who need to:

- 🔍 Quickly spot missing translations between language files
- 🎯 Identify untranslated placeholder text that's been copied across files
- ✏️ Edit translations directly without switching tools
- 💾 Keep translation files in sync across your project
- 🔒 Work with sensitive data locally (nothing uploaded to servers)
- 🌐 Multilingual interface (English and French)

## ✨ What You Can Do

### Compare Translation Files

Upload your JSON localization files (e.g., `en.json` and `fr.json`) and instantly see:

- 🔴 **Missing keys** - Translations that exist in one file but not the other
- 🟡 **Identical values** - Potential untranslated text (same value in both languages)
- ⚪ **Different values** - Properly translated content

### Edit On-the-Spot

- **Add missing keys** with one click to either file
- **Inline editing** — click any identical-status primitive value (string, number, boolean, null) to edit it directly in the tree
- **Type-safe parsing** — edited values are automatically converted back to the correct JSON type (e.g., `"true"` → `true`, `"42"` → `42`)
- **Fix placeholders** without leaving your browser

### Export Your Updates

- **Download modified files** with all your changes
- **Prettify JSON** for consistent formatting
- **Clean diffs** for easier version control

## 🔒 Privacy & Security

- **100% client-side** - All processing happens in your browser
- **No uploads** - Your files never leave your computer
- **No tracking** - We don't collect or store your data
- **Open source** - Inspect the code yourself on [GitHub](https://github.com/iirving/json-l10n-diff)

## � Getting Started

### For End Users

**Coming Soon!** The tool will be available at a hosted URL. Simply:

1. Visit the website
2. Upload your first JSON translation file
3. Upload your second JSON translation file
4. Review differences with color-coded highlighting
5. Edit, add missing keys, and export your updated files

No installation required—just open your browser and start comparing!

### For Developers

## 📝 Use Cases

### Scenario 1: Finding Missing Translations

You've added new features to your app and need to ensure all languages are up to date.

```text
✅ Upload en.json (your main language file)
✅ Upload fr.json (French translations)
🔴 Missing keys highlighted instantly
➕ Add missing keys with one click
💾 Save updated fr.json
```

### Scenario 2: Catching Untranslated Placeholders

Sometimes placeholder text gets copied instead of translated.

```text
✅ Upload en.json: { "welcome": "Welcome" }
✅ Upload fr.json: { "welcome": "Welcome" }
🟡 Identical values highlighted in yellow
✏️ Click the value to edit inline → "Bienvenue"
💾 Save corrected fr.json
```

### Scenario 3: Team Synchronization

Multiple team members working on translations? Keep files in sync.

```text
✅ Compare your local changes against the main branch
🔴 See what others added that you're missing
➕ Add new keys to your file
💾 Export and commit synchronized files
```

## 💡 How It Works

1. **Upload** - Drag and drop or select your JSON files
2. **Parse** - Files are validated and structured into a nested tree
3. **Compare** - Differences are calculated and color-coded (missing, identical, different)
4. **Edit** - Click identical values to edit inline, or add missing keys with one click
5. **Export** - Download your modified files with prettified JSON

All processing happens in your browser—fast, secure, and private.

## ❓ FAQ

**Q: What file formats are supported?**
A: Valid JSON files only. The tool validates your files on upload.

**Q: Is there a file size limit?**
A: Yes, 10 MB per file. This is sufficient for even very large translation projects.

**Q: Can I use this offline?**
A: Yes! Once loaded, the app works completely offline. (Note: Initial download requires internet)

**Q: Do you support other formats (YAML, XML, etc.)?**
A: Currently JSON only. Other formats may be added based on user demand.

**Q: How are keys counted for tier limits?**
A: Every key including parent objects counts. Example: `{ "user": { "profile": { "name": "John" } } }` = 3 keys.

**Q: What happens if I exceed my tier limit?**
A: You'll see an error message and be prompted to upgrade or use a smaller file.
